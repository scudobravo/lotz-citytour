This notice is provided pursuant to Article 13 of EU Regulation 2016/679, General Data Protection Regulation (also known as "GDPR").

Types of Personal Data Processed
The Data Controller processes the following personal data of the user (data subject): phone number, mobile IP address, and location. The latter, although not directly collected through the app, can be inferred from the service requested. The Data Controller is solely responsible for the processing of the personal data provided to it. It is specified that the service is intended for individuals who are at least 16 years old.

Methods of Processing Personal Data
The processing is carried out using digital tools, with organizational methods and logic strictly related to the purpose of providing the service requested by the user (data subject), ensuring an adequate level of protection of personal data.

Purpose and Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data
The personal data provided will be processed to enable the use of the service called LotzArt, which transforms the user\'s smartphone into an audio guide. The legal basis for the processing is the contract pursuant to Article 6.1b) of the GDPR, arising from the request for service by the interested user. With the explicit consent of the user, the Data Controller may send communications regarding other activities and initiatives. The legal basis that legitimizes the processing is the consent under Article 6.1a) of the GDPR, which for minors under 18 will be provided pursuant to Article 8 of the GDPR. The Data Controller may also collect the specific consent of the user if the user wishes to be informed about activities and initiatives from third parties, which will be specifically indicated from time to time. It is specified that consent is always optional, and failing to provide it does not affect the possibility of using the service.

Communication and Dissemination of Personal Data
The user\'s personal data may be communicated to external parties involved in providing the service and appointed as Data Processors by the Data Controller. In any case, the communication of personal data required by law to law enforcement, the judiciary, information and security agencies, or other public bodies for purposes of defense or security of the state or for the prevention, investigation, or repression of crimes is reserved. In cases where the data subject consents to receive communications from third parties, the Data Controller will share the data with those subjects qualified as independent data controllers. The personal data will not be subject to dissemination.

Storage of Personal Data
Personal data will be processed for the time necessary to achieve the purposes described in this document, which means for the entire duration of the service usage. Such data will be retained for 2 years from the end of the service, after which they will be anonymized and kept for statistical purposes. If the user no longer wishes to receive communications regarding other activities, they may revoke their consent at any time. The revocation of consent will be immediately recorded by the Data Controller but will not apply to campaigns already planned prior to the receipt of the request.

Rights of Data Subjects
Data subjects are individuals to whom the Personal Data relates, and they can exercise the rights provided for in Articles 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, and 21 of EU Regulation 2016/679 (which can be consulted at the following link: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/IT/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=IT).
